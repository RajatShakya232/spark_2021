The main Python Code is in the Main.ipynb. The file can be opened in Jupyter Notebook, and executed. 
The other two .ipynb files contain additional helper code, that may be accessed if debugging is needed, or if new code is to be added.

The pyExcel_sheets contain all the excel workbooks. 
The Fragility.xlsm and EP_methodology.xlsm files may be opened to perform resilience and AAL calculations respectively.

NOTE: Do not change the names or locations of any of the files, as this may cause the code to not works properly.
